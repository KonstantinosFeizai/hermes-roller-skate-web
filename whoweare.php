      <p class="section-intro">
        Welcome to <strong>Hermes Roller Skating Academy</strong>. We are a community that promotes the love
        of <strong>rollerskating</strong> and related sports (snowski & iceskating) for all ages. We are
        gradually inviting external coaches in various disciplines (dancing, freestyle, racing) and organize
        sports trips focusing on these sports.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              Our mission is to promote a culture of entertainment, free expression, and safety in
              traffic through rollerskating. We believe that rollerskating offers a quality choice for
              family activities and is a means to encourage the creation of safe learning and
              transportation infrastructures. We learn to fall so we know how to get up â€“ not only on
              skates, but in life.

            <li>
              <i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> <strong>Pedagogical Approach</strong>: Our coaches set
              clear disciplinary rules and boundaries, while giving children the opportunity to
              express themselves and promote creative thinking.

              <i class="fas fa-skating fa-lg" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
              <strong>Variety of Classes</strong>: In addition to
              basic and racing training, we collaborate with external instructors for specialized
              sessions of freestyle, aggressive, and dancing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> <strong>Progressive Training</strong>:
              Rollerskates can substitute for both snow-skiing and ice-skating when conditions are not
              ideal, providing a versatile experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> <strong>Community &amp; Events</strong>: We are
              committed to strengthening our community by offering the best services prices,
              organizing unforgettable events, and creating unique family sports tourism programs.
